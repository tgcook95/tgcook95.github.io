				My name is Taylor Cook, and I am in my last semester of college as an MIS major.  
				I decided to take MIS after a number of different majorscuurrently have an internship 
				at Union Pacific, where I work in IT on a special project team, deploying thousands of 
				computers out to all of the employees after doing something we call a "BILD" process.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Outside of work and school, I live at home with my girlfriend Maddy, coach youth sports, 
				and build computers. I am from Omaha and have never lived anywhere else, but do have 
				aspiration to move somewhere with less harsh of winters.
